          Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
          determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
          in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
          provide information so that we can match it with information you have
          previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request
          you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we
          can match the information you provide with the information we already
          have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method
          (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may
