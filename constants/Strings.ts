    "Landing": "We are a Coaching for Profits program that specializes in 6-max cash games. In our experience the CFP model is the best coaching model as the student’s and coaches goals are completely aligned. \n\n Our goal is to equip our students with the necessary skills required to move up to the highest stakes. To achieve this we teach a theoretically sound approach that uses efficient simplifications to achieve an implementable winning strategy.",

    "TestimonialJakeMarples": "What separates Poker With Riske from the other coaching I've received before is that the program is incredibly organized and breaks complex ideas into well-structured, implementable heuristics. The community is very active and supportive, and through the program I've become more passionate about poker than I ever was before.",
    "TestimonialAdam": "I joined the CFP as a semi-recreational small winner at 50nl with a decent grasp of theory but not really able to apply it correctly. Poker With Riske completely transformed the way I think about poker and how to actually apply theory in all kinds of lineups. All the coaches are active players in todays games crushing 500nl+. The combination of knowledge the coaches are able to offer from theory/exploits to playing against recreational players is unbelievable. I'm now currently playing 200nl with 7-8bb/100 with an aim to crush even higher!",
    "TestimonialChrisD": "After a full year in the CFP, I can say without a doubt I wouldn’t be a fraction of the player I am today without Poker With Riske's help. I went from a small winner at 100NL, to beating 500NL. Something that felt completely out of reach a year ago.",
